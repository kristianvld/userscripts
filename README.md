# Some useful Userscripts
A small collection of personal userscripts for everyday use.

### What is userscripts?
Userscripts are small javascript files that can be loaded by browser plugins to provide additional features or change the layout of a website. E.g. a userscript could add dark mode to website that does not have it yet, or remove clutter/banners that you find distracting, or keyboard shortcuts for features you find yourself using often.

To install the userscripts you will need a plugin like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) or similar.


### How to install
Click on the file you want to install, then click on the "Raw" button. If you have Tampermonkey or similar installed, the plugin should automatically ask you if you want to install the script yourself. You will also be able to view the code before installing. After installing you can also edit the script to fit your needs.
